This is a python script to search, stream and download music and videos and make You-tube downloading much simpler and better.
Just edit the config.txt file and change the url to necessary playlist url or you can simply run the video_downloader.py, it will automatically ask for the file. Whenever videos are added to the playlist it will get automatically downloaded in the system you are running the script.
</br> Instead of using video_downloader.py you can actually go for a cron job that run the script according to your need. Inorder to run the video_downloader.py in background you can daemonize it, you can add it into the services, or create a virtual terminal using screen and run the script there. 
</br>This implementation uses YouTube as a source of content and can play and download video as well as audio. The pafy library handles interfacing with YouTube.
</br></br> Thank You. Enjoy!
