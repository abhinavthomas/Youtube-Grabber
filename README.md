This is a python script to search, stream and download music and videos and make You-tube downloading much simpler and better.
Just edit the config.txt file and change the url to necessary playlist url. Whenever videos are added to the playlist it will automatically downloaded in the system you are running the script.
</br>This implementation uses YouTube as a source of content and can play and download video as well as audio. The pafy library handles interfacing with YouTube.
</br> Thank You.Enjoy!
