This is a python script to search, stream and download music and videos and make You-tube downloading much simpler and better.
Just edit the config.txt file and change the url to necessary playlist url. Whenever videos are added to the playlist it will get automatically downloaded in the system you are running the script.
</br> Instead of using timer.py you can actually go for a cron job that run the script according to your need. Inorder to run the timer in background you can daemonize it, you can add it into the services, or create a virtual terminal using screen and run timer.py there. 
</br>This implementation uses YouTube as a source of content and can play and download video as well as audio. The pafy library handles interfacing with YouTube.
</br></br> Thank You. Enjoy!
